If you want self host you need to be able to meet these conditions on your host in order to use the script.

:::caution Supported host build platforms
âœ… Debian: `Bullseye`

âœ… Ubuntu: `Focal` `Jammy`

âœ… Alpine: `3.10` or greater

âœ… WSL2 images of the above hosts (not recommended if you actively use the image)

âœ… WSL2 + docker of the above hosts
:::

:::caution Bash Shell
âœ… This is 100% a modern bash shell script and it requires having access to bash to run it.
:::

:::caution sudo or root privileges
âœ… The script needs to install some system dependencies in order to proceed and if you do not have permission or access to do this or no access to docker to use a container you must find a more suitable host environment.
:::

:::caution Emulation requirements
âœ… If you build using Qt6 you will need to have these dependencies installed on the host, <Tips>qemu and binmtfs:qemu</Tips>
